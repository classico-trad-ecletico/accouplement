'Accouplement,' defined in Quatremère de Quincy's 1788 volume of the
*Encyclopédie* as a 'fault' and 'a first step taken on the way of the vice,'
consists in the use of paired columns in a free-standing colonnade.
It was both a recurring motif in French architecture as well as a matter
of controversy in structural and aesthetic theory.
Its earliest uses can be traced to the Renaissance, perhaps in
Philibert Delorme's Château of Anet (1543--1566),
but the canonical exemplar, and the only one notable enough for Quatremère
to bother discussing at length, is the Louvre Colonnade (1667--1676)
championed by one of its designers, Claude Perrault.
The controversy sparked by this monument lasted up to
the early twentieth century.
Debates about proportions, historic precedents, and decoration
alternated with concerns regarding thrust resistance, flat arches,
and iron reinforcement in the writings and designs that theorists,
practising architects, and structural engineers produced over the course
of two and a half centuries after the Louvre Colonnade, all the way to
Auguste Perret's designs for the Trocadero (unbuilt) and the Garde-meuble
in the 1930s.

This paper offers an account of the usage and attitudes towards
the coupled columns motif in France.
The guiding thread is its critical fortune as part of discourses
on the relationship between structural stability and visual delight,
beginning with the argument for a 'French order' of architecture
put forward by Delorme under the rationale of the performance of
French limestone versus classical marble.
This discussion then tied into the argument that *accouplement* was a variation
on bundled Gothic piers, explicitly raised by Mauremont (1845)
and implicitly suggested by Perrault himself in a later defence of
indigenous French tradition---although Serlio,
who worked and published in France, can also be credited with making the case
for bringing Gothic resources into the scope of Renaissance architecture.
Finally, the practical usefulness and even moral suitability
of iron reinforcement were at the forefront of the debate ever since
François Blondel's early critique of the Louvre Colonnade.
It accounts for this monument's influence on Soufflot's and Rondelet's work
at the French Pantheon as well as the latter's structural theory,
and all the way up to the Perrets's argument for the place
of reinforced concrete within the domain of monumental architecture.
